## 🚀 Recommended Testing Priority

### Phase 1 - Critical (Immediate)

1. **Browse Books Page** - Core functionality, completely untested
2. **Exchanges Page** - Main feature of the app, completely untested
3. **Registration Flow** - Essential user onboarding
4. **Dashboard** - Landing page after login

### Phase 2 - Important (Short-term)

1. **Book Management** (Edit/Delete) - Complete CRUD operations
2. **Exchange Workflow Integration** - End-to-end scenarios
3. **Header & Navigation** - User experience critical

### Phase 3 - Polish (Medium-term)

1. **UI Components** - Badge counters, responsive design
2. **Edge Cases** - Form limits, concurrent updates
3. **Performance** - Loading states, error handling

## 🛠 Testing Infrastructure Improvements Needed

1. **Database Seeding**: Implement proper test data seeding for complex scenarios
2. **Multi-User Testing**: Add commands for creating and switching between test users
3. **API Mocking**: Consider intercepting API calls for more reliable tests
4. **Custom Commands**: Add more reusable commands for common actions
5. **Visual Testing**: Consider adding visual regression testing
6. **Accessibility Testing**: Add a11y testing with cypress-axe

## 📊 Current Test Files Summary

- **`login.cy.js`**: 7 comprehensive tests covering authentication flow
- **`add-book.cy.js`**: 9 tests covering book creation functionality
- **Missing**: Tests for Browse Books, Dashboard, Exchanges, Registration, Book Management

The current test coverage focuses on the basic user flows but misses the core exchange functionality that makes this app unique.
